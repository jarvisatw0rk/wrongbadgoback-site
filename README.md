# wrongbadgoback-site
HTML, CSS and additional code for my wbgb site, which is a passion project inspired by early 2000s internet and comic sites. 

It includes places to read my comics, mini games of the comic characters, and a site generally inspired by early comic reading websites that I appreciate the design of.

The site is a steady work in progress, started around the end of January 2025, but has been a joy to design and code for so far. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
